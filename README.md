Green Leaf was a Loyalty Based Platrform developed in my final year gaining inspiration from my placement year during university working in the loyalty app industry.

The purpose of Green Leaf is to be used at numerous types of organisations that provide food daily for their employees, students or individuals who regularly eat at their canteen/food service. These organisations range from schools, University Halls, office canteens and many more!

Users of Green Leaf will let their organisation what days they will be eating at said organisations provider. The goal is that the organisation will have a clear picture of how much food they need to prepare in advance each day from the user's submissions. Thus, reduce food wastage.
